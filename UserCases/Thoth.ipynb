      "1. Prepare 5’/3’ primer working stock by diluting each primer 1:10 into a single clean Eppendorf tube from an intial 100 uM stock (ex: 16 uL ddH20 + 2 uL 5’ primer + 2 uL 3’ primer in 20 uL total). Each PCR reaction will require 1 uL of primer mix, but due to pipetting error, it is good practice to generate at least 5-10 extra samples. Final concentration of each primer in the mix in 500 nM.\n",
      "2. To set up the PCR master mix, use the table below: #colonies to screen/#rxns to prep Single reaction 12/16 48/56 96/112 5’/3’ mix 1 16 56 112 2x OneTaq Master Mix 10 160 560 1120 ddH O 9 144 504 1008 Final volume (uL) 20 320 1120 2240; OneTaq 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer - 500 rxns New England Biolabs Catalog #M0482L\n",
      "3. Pipette 20 mL of PCR master mix into appropriate PCR tubes (keep tubes/plate on ice).\n",
      "4. Using a 10 uL pipette tip, pick a small amount of Phaeodactylum biomass from the patch on an agar plate. This is roughly equivalent to the amount of biomass one would select for screening E coli colonies and is just enough to see the diatom biomass on the end of the tip. If you overload the reaction with biomass, a nonspecific DNA band can be visualized on an agarose gel at roughly 800bp-1kb. Place the tip with biomass into the appropriate PCR tube on ice and leave it there. Continue picking samples from agar plates, placing pipet tips in the PCR mixes on ice.\n",
      "5. If a positive control plasmid is available, add 1 uL of 0.5-1.0 ng/uL purified plasmid to a tube containing 19 uL of PCR master mix or 1 uL of ddH20 for negative/water control.\n",
      "6. Once picking is finished, use a P20 pipet set at 10 uL to pipet each reaction up and down multiple times, releasing the cells from the pipet tip. The color of the reaction will be a light brown if the appropriate amount of biomass was collected. We also suggest using a multichannel pipet for clearing out the tips when a larger number of colonies are being screened (24 and up). If desired, briefly spin the PCR tubes to remove bubbles from pipetting. We have not seen any difference in PCR efficiency when tubes are spun versus leaving in the bubbles.\n",
      "7. Set up the PCR program on thermocycler. Our standard protocol for PCR using OneTaq is: Step 1: 95oC for 2 min; Step 2: 95oC for 10 sec; Step 3: Annealing temp for 20 sec (we often aim for 60oC at this step); Step 4: 72oC for appropriate extension time (1kb/min with OneTaq); Step 5: Go to Step 2 29 additional times (30 total cycles); Step 6: 72oC for 5 min; Step 7: Hold at 10oC or end program; Note: Once the cycles are finished, the samples can be stored at 4oC overnight (-20oC for longer).\n",
      "8. To analyze the reaction on a gel, add 4 uL of 6x DNA loading dye to each tube. Briefly spin the tubes to mix buffer with sample and flick tubes to mix. On a 1% agarose gel, load 16 uL of samples + dye mix. If 1ng of positive control plasmid was used, load 8 uL of final reaction so to not blow out the gel when imaged. Run gel and image with appropriate DNA stain/imaging system. This protocol was developed using gels stained with EtBr and imaged on a BioRad GelDoc XR System. Other systems and stain combinations may require loading more or less of the final PCR reaction.\n"
